The goal of this project is to try to simulate the affects of random error along with the principles of Noisy Channel Encoding Theory will have on the outcomes and conclusions of "big data" and health services research.

First step is to create simulated data-sets and then injecting them is various amount of random noise into the data set and measure the amount of change in the results of various statics.

We will use a Random Seed of 369 (Nicholas Tesla number) for all data-set to create reproducible. All code will be visible and

```{r}

```
